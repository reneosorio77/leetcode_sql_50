    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a solution to find the users who have valid emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "A valid e-mail has a prefix name and a domain where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The prefix name is a string that may contain letters (upper or lower case), digits, underscore '_', period '.', and/or dash '-'. The prefix name must start with a letter.\n",
    "- The domain is '@leetcode.com'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the result table in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input:\n",
    "**Users table:**\n",
    "| user_id | name      | mail                    |\n",

    "# Intuition\n",
    "The task involves validating email addresses from a database table. The validation should check if the email starts with a letter, followed by allowed characters, and ends with '@leetcode.com'.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "- Use SQL's `REGEXP` function to match the email pattern. \n",
    "- The pattern `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_\\.\\-]*@leetcode\\.com$` ensures:\n",
    "  - The email starts with a letter.\n",
    "  - Followed by any number of letters, numbers, underscores, dots, or hyphens.\n",
    "  - Ends exactly with '@leetcode.com'.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solution for mySQL\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql mysql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM Users\n",
    "WHERE mail REGEXP '^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_\\.\\-]*@leetcode\\.com$';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "This solution checks for valid emails based on the given criteria using a regular expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "For SQL you cannot use REGEX unfortunately, I tried with % and LIKE but I failed to find out a concise solution. Should be something like :\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM Emails\n",
    "WHERE email LIKE '[a-zA-Z]%'\n",
    "  AND email LIKE '%@leetcode.com'\n",
    "  AND SUBSTRING(email, 1, 1) BETWEEN 'a' AND 'z' -- Crude start with letter check\n",
    "  AND SUBSTRING(email, 1, 1) BETWEEN 'A' AND 'Z' -- Crude start with letter check\n",
    "  AND email NOT LIKE '%#%'\n",
    "  AND email NOT LIKE '% %'\n",
    "  AND email NOT LIKE '%.@%'\n",
    "  AND email NOT LIKE '%..%'\n",
    "  -- ... other NOT LIKE conditions ...  (This gets very long and complex)\n",
    ";\n",
    "\n",
    "So I think that with SQL not supporting REGEX you cannot do it. Please let me know if you find a way to do it in SQL using LIKE and %.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the MYSQL solution above \n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows in the Users table, and m is the average length of each email string due to regex matching.\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(1) for the operation itself, considering only the query execution. If we include the result set, it would be O(k) where k is the number of valid emails."
