    "# SQL Query for Identifying Low Fat and Recyclable Products\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a table called `Products` with the following schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **product_id**: An integer representing the unique identifier for each product.\n",
    "- **low_fats**: An enum field that can be 'Y' for low fat or 'N' for not low fat.\n",
    "- **recyclable**: An enum field that can be 'Y' for recyclable or 'N' for not recyclable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement**: We need to write an SQL query to find the `product_id` of products that are both low fat and recyclable. The result should list these IDs in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how the `Products` table might look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "+-------------+----------+------------+\n",
    "| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |\n",
    "+-------------+----------+------------+\n",
    "| 0           | Y        | N          |\n",
    "| 1           | Y        | Y          |\n",
    "| 2           | N        | Y          |\n",
    "| 3           | Y        | Y          |\n",
    "| 4           | N        | N          |\n",
    "+-------------+----------+------------+\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "The task requires us to filter products based on two conditions simultaneously:\n",
    "They must be low fat (low_fats = 'Y').\n",
    "They must be recyclable (recyclable = 'Y').\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach\n",
    "We will use a simple SQL SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to filter the products according to our criteria. No joins or subqueries are needed since all information is within a single table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "Select: Choose only the product_id field from the Products table.\n",
    "Filter: Apply conditions where low_fats and recyclable are both 'Y'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the Products table. Each row is evaluated once.\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(1), as we are not using additional data structures that grow with input size. The space for storing the result is minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Query\n",
    "Here's the SQL query to solve this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    product_id\n",
    "FROM \n",
    "    Products\n",
    "WHERE \n",
    "    low_fats = 'Y' \n",
    "    AND recyclable = 'Y';\n"
