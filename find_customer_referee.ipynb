    "# SQL Query for Customers Not Referred by Customer with ID = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer**\n",
    "  - **id**: INT PRIMARY KEY\n",
    "  - **name**: VARCHAR(255)\n",
    "  - **referee_id**: INT\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the names of customers that are not referred by the customer with `id = 2`. \n",
    "The result table can be in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how the `Customer` table might look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "+----+------+------------+\n",
    "| id | name | referee_id |\n",
    "+----+------+------------+\n",
    "| 1  | Will | null       |\n",
    "| 2  | Jane | null       |\n",
    "| 3  | Alex | 2          |\n",
    "| 4  | Bill | null       |\n",

    "| 6  | Mark | 2          |\n",
    "+----+------+------------+\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "We need to identify customers whose referee_id is either NULL or not equal to 2. This means we're looking for customers who either have no referee or have a referee other than customer 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach\n",
    "Select: We'll select the name column from the Customer table.\n",
    "Filter: Use a WHERE clause to exclude customers with referee_id = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "Select: Only the name of the customer.\n",
    "Where: Apply the condition where referee_id is NULL or not equal to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the Customer table. Each row must be checked.\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(1), as we're selecting one column without additional storage relative to input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Query\n",
    "Here's the SQL query to solve this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT name\n",
    "FROM Customer\n",
    "WHERE referee_id IS NULL OR referee_id != 2;\n",
    "\n",
    "+------+\n",

    "+------+\n",
    "| Will |\n",
    "| Jane |\n",
    "| Bill |\n",
