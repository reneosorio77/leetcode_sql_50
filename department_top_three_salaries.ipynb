    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Employee Table:**\n",
    "| id | name  | salary | departmentId |\n",
    "|----|-------|--------|--------------|\n",
    "| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |\n",
    "| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |\n",
    "| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |\n",
    "| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |\n",
    "| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |\n",
    "| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |\n",
    "| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Department Table:**\n",
    "| id | name  |\n",
    "|----|-------|\n",
    "| 1  | IT    |\n",
    "| 2  | Sales |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "| Department | Employee | Salary |\n",
    "|------------|----------|--------|\n",
    "| IT         | Max      | 90000  |\n",
    "| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |\n",
    "| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |\n",
    "| IT         | Will     | 70000  |\n",
    "| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |\n",
    "| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- In IT, Max earns the highest unique salary, Joe and Randy share the second-highest, and Will has the third-highest.\n",
    "- In Sales, Henry earns the highest, Sam the second, and there's no third as only two employees exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Intuition\n",
    "We need to rank salaries within each department, ensuring that ties for top positions are included. Using a window function like `DENSE_RANK()` will allow us to assign ranks without gaps, which is necessary for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "We'll use a CTE to:\n",
    "1. Join the `Employee` and `Department` tables.\n",
    "2. Rank each employee's salary within their department.\n",
    "3. Select only those employees whose rank is in the top three.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: $$O(n \\log n)$$, where n is the number of employees, due to sorting for ranking.\n",
    "- **Space complexity**: $$O(n)$$ for the intermediate results stored in the CTE.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH cte AS (\n",
    "    SELECT \n",
    "        d.name AS Department,\n",
    "        e.name AS Employee,\n",
    "        e.salary AS Salary,\n",
    "        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY d.name ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS rnk\n",
    "    FROM Employee e\n",
    "    JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT Department, Employee, Salary\n",
    "FROM cte\n",
    "WHERE rnk <= 3\n",
    "ORDER BY Department, Salary DESC;"
