    "# Intuition\n",
    "The goal here is to find customers who have purchased every product listed in the Product table. We need to compare the count of distinct products each customer has bought with the total number of products available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "My first thought was to use a CTE to count the distinct products per customer and then filter those whose count matches the total products, which turned out to be efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lessons Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem emphasizes the importance of understanding data relationships and using efficient SQL constructs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency through Simplicity**: Simpler SQL queries often lead to better performance, especially when dealing with aggregation operations.\n",
    "- **Understanding Data**: Knowing how your data is structured helps in choosing the right SQL approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution 1: Using CTE\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH number_diff_products AS (\n",
    "    SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT(product_key)) AS n_product\n",
    "    FROM Customer \n",
    "    GROUP BY customer_id\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT customer_id\n",
    "FROM number_diff_products ndf\n",
    "WHERE n_product = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product)"

    "#### Pros:\n",
    "Efficiently counts distinct products per customer in one pass.\n",
    "Simple to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons:\n",
    "Requires CTE support, but this is widely available in modern SQL systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use: When simplicity and efficiency are key, and you want to avoid complex joins or subqueries."

    "# Second approach : USING JOIN and HAVING\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "SELECT c.customer_id AS customer_id \n",
    "FROM Customer c\n",
    "JOIN Product p ON p.product_key = c.product_key\n",
    "GROUP BY c.customer_id\n",
    "HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p.product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product)"
   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Pros:\n",
    "- Directly joins the Customer and Product tables, which can be intuitive for some.\n",
    "- Uses standard SQL constructs like JOIN and HAVING.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "- Might be less efficient due to the join operation, especially if there's no direct relationship between customer and product through `product_key`.\n",
    "- Can be confusing if the relationship between Customer and Product isn't clear or if there's no actual key to join on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use:\n",
    "When you prefer a more traditional SQL approach or when the relationship between tables is clear and direct.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- **CTE Approach (Solution 1)** is generally more efficient as it performs a single aggregation over the Customer table, avoiding a join operation.\n",
    "- **JOIN Approach (Solution 2)** could be slower due to the join operation, which adds complexity, especially if indexed poorly or if the dataset is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- Both solutions have a similar space complexity of **$O(n)$** where **$n$** is the number of unique customers, used to store intermediate results or join results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CTE Approach (Solution 1)** is **more efficient** due to:\n",
    "  - Avoiding the join operation, which can be resource-intensive.\n",
    "  - Simplicity in structure, leading to better readability and potentially better optimization by the database engine.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **JOIN and HAVING Approach (Solution 2)**:\n",
    "  - While functional, it might not utilize database resources as efficiently due to the join operation unless optimized with proper indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the CTE Approach is Preferred:\n",
    "- The CTE approach leverages the database's ability to handle aggregations efficiently without the overhead of joining tables unnecessarily. It directly addresses the problem by counting distinct products per customer and comparing this with the total product count, which aligns well with the logical flow of the problem.\n",
    "- In terms of performance, simplicity often translates to efficiency in SQL, especially with modern query optimizers. The CTE method reduces the complexity of the query, making it easier for the database to execute and for developers to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts:\n",
    "- For this particular problem, the CTE approach not only provides a cleaner, more logical solution but also demonstrates better performance characteristics, making it the preferred method for most practical applications. However, understanding both methods helps in choosing the right tool for different scenarios in SQL programming."
