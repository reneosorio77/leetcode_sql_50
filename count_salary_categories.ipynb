    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Low Salary\": All the salaries strictly less than $20,000.\n",
    "- \"Average Salary\": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20,000, $50,000].\n",
    "- \"High Salary\": All the salaries strictly greater than $50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Return the result table in any order.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input:\n",
    "**Accounts table:**\n",
    "| account_id | income |\n",
    "|------------|--------|\n",
    "| 3          | 108939 |\n",
    "| 2          | 12747  |\n",
    "| 8          | 87709  |\n",
    "| 6          | 91796  |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "| category       | accounts_count |\n",
    "|----------------|----------------|\n",
    "| Low Salary     | 1              |\n",
    "| Average Salary | 0              |\n",
    "| High Salary    | 3              |\n",
    "\n",
    "# Intuition\n",
    "The goal is to categorize each account's income into predefined salary brackets and count how many accounts belong to each category. We need to make sure all categories are included in the output, even if one or more have zero counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "- **Direct Summation**: Utilize `SUM` with boolean conditions to count the number of accounts in each category.\n",
    "- **Ensure All Categories**: Use `UNION` to ensure all categories are listed, even if they have zero accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the two solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Solution 1: Using SUM with boolean conditions\n",
    "SELECT \"Low Salary\" AS category,\n",
    "    SUM(income < 20000) AS accounts_count\n",
    "FROM Accounts\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "SELECT \"Average Salary\" AS category,\n",
    "    SUM(income >= 20000 AND income <= 50000) AS accounts_count\n",
    "FROM Accounts\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "SELECT \"High Salary\" AS category,\n",
    "    SUM(income > 50000) AS accounts_count\n",
    "FROM Accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Solution 2. Equally efficient more complicated but better for later customizations.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "\n",
    "WITH Categories AS (\n",
    "    SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category\n",
    "    UNION ALL\n",
    "    SELECT 'Average Salary'\n",
    "    UNION ALL\n",
    "    SELECT 'High Salary'\n",
    "),\n",
    "cte AS (\n",
    "    SELECT *,\n",
    "        CASE \n",
    "            WHEN income < 20000 THEN 'Low Salary'\n",
    "            WHEN income >= 20000 AND income <= 50000 THEN 'Average Salary'\n",
    "            ELSE 'High Salary'\n",
    "        END AS category\n",
    "    FROM Accounts\n",
    "),\n",
    "SalaryCounts AS (\n",
    "SELECT category,\n",
    "       COUNT(*) AS accounts_count\n",
    "FROM cte\n",
    "GROUP BY category\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT c.category, COALESCE(sc.accounts_count, 0) AS accounts_count  \n",
    "FROM Categories c\n",
    "LEFT JOIN SalaryCounts sc ON c.category = sc.category;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Winner\n",
    "Solution 1 is selected as the winner due to its simplicity, which directly addresses the problem without additional complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Both solutions have equal complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of rows in the Accounts table since we scan the table once for each condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity: O(1) for the final result set as we only output three rows. However, during execution, temporary space might be used, but this doesn't affect the final output complexity."
