    "# Intuition\n",
    "When solving this problem, my first thought was to identify employees whose managers are no longer listed in the company's employee records. This suggests that we need to compare the `manager_id` of each employee with the existing `employee_id`s in the table. Since we're dealing with a scenario where managers might have left, we need to ensure we exclude employees who do not have a manager (where `manager_id` is `NULL`).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "**Subquery Approach:** \n",
    "The approach involves using a subquery to list all current employees' IDs. Then, we filter the main table to select employees whose `manager_id` does not match any `employee_id` from this subquery. This ensures we are only selecting employees whose managers are not in the company. Additionally, we need to handle the case where an employee might not have a manager by excluding `NULL` values for `manager_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Join Approach:**\n",
    "An alternative approach is to use a `LEFT JOIN` to find employees where there's no corresponding manager in the table. Here, we join the Employees table with itself where the `manager_id` of one instance should match the `employee_id` of another. If there's no match (i.e., the manager isn't found), it indicates that the manager has left.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- Time complexity (Subquery): \n",
    "  O(n^2) in the worst case where `n` is the number of rows in the Employees table. This is because for each employee, we are checking if their `manager_id` exists in the result of the subquery, which could potentially scan the entire table for each comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time complexity (Join): \n",
    "  O(n) typically, as most database systems optimize joins efficiently, especially with appropriate indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Space complexity (Subquery): \n",
    "  O(n) due to the storage needed for the subquery result, which lists all `employee_id`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Space complexity (Join): \n",
    "  O(n) for the result set, although the actual space used during execution might be less due to the efficiency of join operations.\n",
