    "# Intuition\n",
    "The key is to keep adding passengers' weights in turn order until the total exceeds 1000 kg. The last person added before this limit is exceeded is the answer. We need to use a window function to compute the cumulative sum of weights as we go through the turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "- Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the running total of weights (`cum_weight`) as passengers board in order.\n",
    "- Filter to keep only those where the cumulative weight does not exceed 1000 kg.\n",
    "- From those, select the one with the highest `turn` number to ensure we get the \"last\" person fitting on the bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity:**\n",
    "  O(n log n) due to the sorting required by `ORDER BY`. Here, `n` is the number of passengers. The window function for cumulative sum is generally linear in practice but could approach $$O(n \\log n)$$ for very large datasets due to sorting operations within the window function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity:**\n",
    "  O(n) as we need to store a running sum for each passenger in the CTE.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH cum_sum AS (\n",
    "    SELECT \n",
    "        person_name, \n",
    "        weight, \n",
    "        turn,\n",
    "        SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY turn) AS cum_weight\n",
    "    FROM \n",
    "        Queue\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    person_name\n",
    "FROM \n",
    "    cum_sum\n",
    "WHERE \n",
    "    cum_weight <= 1000\n",
    "ORDER BY \n",
    "    turn DESC\n",
    "LIMIT 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Second solution using a subquery\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT person_name\n",
    "FROM (\n",
    "    SELECT *,\n",
    "           SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY turn) AS cum_weight\n",
    "    FROM Queue\n",
    ") AS subquery\n",
    "WHERE cum_weight <= 1000\n",
    "ORDER BY cum_weight DESC\n",
