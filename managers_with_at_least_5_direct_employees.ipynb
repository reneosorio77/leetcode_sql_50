    "#  First solution. Avoiding JOINS and using subquery\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "The goal is to identify managers who have at least five direct reports. We need to count the number of employees reporting to each manager and then filter for those with 5 or more reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "- Use a **subquery** to group employees by `managerId` and count them.\n",
    "- Apply **HAVING** to filter managers with 5 or more direct reports.\n",
    "- Use **WHERE id IN (...)** to select these managers' names, avoiding the use of JOINs or Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for simplicity and to potentially reduce complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: \n",
    "  - O(N), where \\( N \\) is the total number of employees. This involves two table scans, optimized by indexing.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Space complexity**: \n",
    "  - O(M), where \\( M \\) is the number of unique managers. Space is used for the intermediate results of the subquery.\n",

    "# SECOND SOLUTION. Using Joins \n",
    "# Intuition\n",
    "The intuition behind this solution is to directly count how many employees report to each manager without using subqueries. We join the `Employee` table with itself to match managers with their reports, then group by the manager's ID to count their direct reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "- Join the `Employee` table with itself to connect managers to their direct reports.\n",
    "- Use `GROUP BY` on the manager's ID to count direct reports.\n",
    "- Use `HAVING` clause to filter managers with at least 5 reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: \n",
    "  - O(N), where \\( N \\) is the total number of employees. The join operation might theoretically be O(N^2) without indexes, but with proper indexing, it's effectively linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity**: \n",
    "  - O(N), where \\( N \\) is the number of employees. We potentially store all employees in memory due to the join operation.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Both solutions aim to identify managers with at least five direct reports, but they differ in their approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution 1** uses a subquery to count direct reports for each manager. This method:\n",
    "  - Avoids the use of `JOIN`, potentially reducing complexity for very large datasets where joins might be costly.\n",
    "  - Utilizes `HAVING` within the subquery for filtering, which might be more intuitive for some developers in understanding the flow of data filtering.\n",
    "  - Has a simpler structure, making it easier to read and understand at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution 2** employs a self-join on the `Employee` table:\n",
    "  - It might perform better in scenarios where the database's query optimizer can efficiently manage the join, especially with proper indexing on `id` and `managerId`.\n",
    "  - This method directly groups the results after joining, which could be more performant in some database systems due to how they handle group operations post-join.\n",
    "  - However, it might consume more memory due to the join operation, especially if the dataset is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Considerations:**\n",
    "- The time complexity for both solutions is generally O(N), where N is the number of employees, but actual performance can vary based on database engine, indexing, and data volume.\n",
    "- Space complexity might favor Solution 1 in scenarios where memory usage needs to be minimized, as it avoids the overhead of joining tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choice of Solution:**\n",
    "- Choose **Solution 1** for simplicity and when dealing with databases where subqueries are optimized well. It's also preferable if you're looking to avoid joins for operational or performance reasons in your specific database environment.\n",
    "- Opt for **Solution 2** if your database system handles joins efficiently and you're comfortable with the potential increase in memory usage for the sake of possibly quicker query execution on smaller to medium-sized datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, both solutions are effective, but the choice depends on your specific database environment, the scale of your data, and performance considerations. Testing both in your actual environment might give you the best insight into which performs better for your use case."
