    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 (`tiv_2016`), for all policyholders who:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have the same `tiv_2015` value as one or more other policyholders, and\n",
    "- Are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (`lat`, `lon`) attribute pairs must be unique).\n",
    "\n",
    "Round `tiv_2016` to two decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insurance table:**\n",
    "| pid | tiv_2015 | tiv_2016 | lat | lon |\n",
    "|-----|----------|----------|-----|-----|\n",
    "| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |\n",
    "| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |\n",
    "| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |\n",
    "| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "| tiv_2016 |\n",
    "|----------|\n",
    "| 45.00    |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Only policyholder with `pid` 4 matches the criteria (sharing `tiv_2015` but having a unique `lat`, `lon` pair).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Intuition\n",
    "The task requires summing `tiv_2016` values for policyholders who share `tiv_2015` with others but have unique `lat` and `lon`. My first thought is to use window functions to count occurrences of these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "I'll use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the count of `tiv_2015` and `lat`, `lon` pairs for each row. Then, I'll filter for rows where `tiv_2015` is shared (`tiv_count > 1`) and the location is unique (`loc_count = 1`), before summing `tiv_2016`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: $$O(n \\log n)$$ due to potential sorting in window functions, although actual performance might be closer to linear with database optimization.\n",
    "- **Space complexity**: $$O(n)$$ for storing the window function results for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH cte AS (\n",
    "    SELECT *,\n",
    "           COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY tiv_2015) AS tiv_count,\n",
    "           COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY lat,lon) AS loc_count\n",
    "    FROM Insurance\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016),2) AS tiv_2016\n",
    "FROM cte\n",
    "WHERE tiv_count > 1 AND loc_count = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method 2 using subqueries\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016\n",
    "FROM Insurance\n",
    "WHERE tiv_2015 IN (\n",
    "    SELECT tiv_2015\n",
    "    FROM Insurance\n",
    "    GROUP BY tiv_2015\n",
    "    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1\n",
    ")\n",
    "AND (lat, lon) IN (\n",
    "    SELECT lat, lon\n",
    "    FROM Insurance\n",
    "    GROUP BY lat, lon\n",
    "    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: $$O(n^2)$$ in worst case due to multiple scans and subqueries.\n",
    "- **Space complexity**: O(n) Potentially less space since it doesn't store all intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Use Method 1 if you require efficiency, but 2 if space is a concern."
