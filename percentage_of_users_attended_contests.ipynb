    "# Intuition\n",
    "The problem requires calculating the percentage of users registered in each contest relative to the total number of users who have registered for any contest. Initially, one might think to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Count how many users are registered for each contest.\n",
    "- Divide this count by the total number of unique users who have registered for any contest.\n",
    "- Format the result to two decimal places for readability.\n",
    "- Note that a common pitfall is to immediately think about joining both tables. No need to use joins. Note that we only need to count users regardless of their participation in contests.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "To solve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Count Users Per Contest**: Use `GROUP BY` to count how many users are in each contest from the `Register` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Total Active Users**: Instead of using all users from the `Users` table, count only the unique users from the `Register` table to get the number of users who have at least one registration. This ensures we're not including users who haven't registered for any contest in our percentage calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Percentage Calculation**: For each contest, compute the percentage by dividing the number of registrations by the count of unique users from the `Register` table, then multiply by 100 to convert to percentage. Use `ROUND` to limit to two decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ordering**: Order the results by the calculated percentage in descending order, using `contest_id` for tie-breaking in ascending order.\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "# Write code\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    contest_id,\n",
    "    ROUND(COUNT(contest_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM Register), 2) AS percentage\n",
    "FROM \n",
    "    Register\n",
    "GROUP BY \n",
    "    contest_id \n",
    "ORDER BY \n",
    "    percentage DESC,\n",
    "    contest_id ASC;"
