    "# Intuition\n",
    "The problem requires finding the fraction of players who return to play the game exactly one day after their first login. We start by identifying each player's first login date, then we check if there's a subsequent login exactly one day later.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify First Login:** Use a CTE to determine the earliest login date for each player.\n",
    "2. **Join and Check for Next Day Login:** Join this CTE with the `Activity` table to check if there's an activity record for each player one day after their first login.\n",
    "3. **Calculate Fraction:** Count those who returned the next day, divide by the total number of players, and round to two decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity:**\n",
    "  - $$O(n \\log n)$$\n",
    "    - Grouping in the CTE involves sorting, which is about \\(O(n \\log n)\\).\n",
    "    - Joining the CTE with the `Activity` table could be \\(O(n \\log n)\\) in the worst case, though with indexing, it might be closer to \\(O(n)\\).\n",
    "    - The counting and division are linear, \\(O(n)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity:**\n",
    "  - $$O(n)$$\n",
    "    - The CTE stores one row per player, leading to linear space usage with respect to the number of players.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "# Write mysql\n",
    "\n",
    "WITH this_table AS (SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login\n",
    "FROM Activity\n",
    "GROUP BY player_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT ROUND(COUNT(*)  / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity),2) AS fraction\n",
    "FROM Activity a\n",
    "JOIN this_table t ON t.player_id = a.player_id\n",
    "WHERE DATEDIFF(a.event_date, t.first_login) = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "-- in SQL DATEDIFF not allowed so use WHERE JULIANDAY(subquery.event_date) - JULIANDAY(subquery.first_login) = 1"
