    "The problem requires calculating the cumulative total amount spent over a 7-day period and the average of this total. We need to consider each day's data along with the previous 6 days to get our 7-day window.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Group by Date:** First, aggregate the amounts by date to get daily totals.\n",
    "2. **Use Window Functions:** \n",
    "   - Use `SUM` with an `OVER` clause to calculate the cumulative sum over the last 7 days.\n",
    "   - Use `AVG` similarly to compute the 7-day average.\n",
    "3. **Offset:** Since we need a full 7 days of data for each row, we'll offset our result set to start from the 7th day onward. You have to use SUM, AVG, ROUND and a special line like \n",
    "OVER(ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 AND CURRENT ROW)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time complexity:** $$O(n \\log n)$$ due to sorting for window functions where \\( n \\) is the number of rows in the `Customer` table.\n",
    "- **Space complexity:** $$O(n)$$ for creating a temporary table with all unique dates.\n",
