    "# Intuition\n",
    "The problem appears to involve calculating the percentage of orders where the delivery date matches the customer's preferred delivery date, but only considering the first order for each customer. Hereâ€™s how I initially think about solving it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identify first orders**: We need to find the earliest order date for each customer.\n",
    "- **Match dates**: Compare these first orders' dates with the customer's preferred delivery date.\n",
    "- **Calculate percentage**: Convert the matches into a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "To solve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subquery for First Orders**: Use a subquery to find the minimum order date for each customer, which represents their first order.\n",
    "- **Main Query**: \n",
    "  - Use the results from the subquery to filter the Delivery table to only include first orders.\n",
    "  - Check if `order_date` equals `customer_pref_delivery_date` for these first orders.\n",
    "  - Calculate the average of these matches (which will be 1 for matches, 0 for non-matches) and convert this to a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time complexity**:\n",
    "  - The subquery involves grouping and finding minimums which is generally O(nlogn) due to sorting or grouping operations where n is the number of rows in Delivery.\n",
    "  - The main query then processes these results, but since we've already filtered down to one order per customer, it essentially processes each customer once, thus still O(nlogn) due to the initial sort/group operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity**:\n",
    "  - Space used is mainly for storing the subquery results which could be up to the number of unique customers, thus O(m) where m is the number of unique customers. However, if we consider the temporary storage for sorting or grouping, this could potentially be O(n) in the worst case for in-memory operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "# Write below\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    ROUND(AVG(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date)*100, 2) AS immediate_percentage\n",
    "FROM Delivery\n",
    "WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN (\n",
    "  SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) \n",
    "  FROM  Delivery\n",
    "  GROUP BY customer_id\n",
