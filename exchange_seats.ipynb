    "# Intuition\n",
    "The problem involves rearranging seat numbers for students where every two students swap their seats unless one student is left unpaired due to an odd count. Here's the thought process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pairing Logic**: Swap the `id` of even and odd students where possible.\n",
    "- **Last Student**: If there's an odd number of students, the last student remains in their seat.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use CASE Statement**: \n",
    "   - Check if the current `id` is even or odd to decide the pairing.\n",
    "   - If `id` is even, swap with the previous odd `id`.\n",
    "   - If `id` is odd, check if it's the maximum `id` (last student) to avoid swapping if unpaired.\n",
    "2. **Ordering**: Ensure the result is sorted by the new `id` in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N) due to the `ORDER BY` clause which sorts the result.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(N) as SQL might need extra space for sorting, depending on the database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    CASE \n",
    "        WHEN id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) AND id % 2 != 0 THEN id\n",
    "        WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1\n",
    "        ELSE id + 1\n",
    "    END AS id,\n",
    "    student\n",
    "FROM Seat\n",
    "ORDER BY id ASC;"
