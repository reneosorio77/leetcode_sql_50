    "# SQL Query to Show Unique ID of Users\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a solution to show the unique ID of each user. If a user does not have a unique ID, just show `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the result table in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** \n",
    "Employees table:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "+----+----------+\n",
    "| id | name     |\n",
    "+----+----------+\n",
    "| 1  | Alice    |\n",
    "| 7  | Bob      |\n",
    "| 11 | Meir     |\n",
    "| 90 | Winston  |\n",
    "| 3  | Jonathan |\n",
    "+----+----------+\n",
    "EmployeeUNI table:\n",
    "sql\n",
    "+----+-----------+\n",
    "| id | unique_id |\n",
    "+----+-----------+\n",
    "| 3  | 1         |\n",
    "| 11 | 2         |\n",
    "| 90 | 3         |\n",
    "+----+-----------+\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: \n",
    "sql\n",
    "+-----------+----------+\n",
    "| unique_id | name     |\n",
    "+-----------+----------+\n",
    "| null      | Alice    |\n",
    "| null      | Bob      |\n",
    "| 2         | Meir     |\n",
    "| 3         | Winston  |\n",
    "| 1         | Jonathan |\n",
    "+-----------+----------+\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "Alice and Bob do not have a unique ID, so we show null.\n",
    "The unique ID of Meir is 2.\n",
    "The unique ID of Winston is 3.\n",
    "The unique ID of Jonathan is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "The task involves linking each employee from the Employees table with their corresponding unique ID from the EmployeeUNI table. We need to ensure that every employee is included, even if they don't have a unique ID, which means we'll use a join operation that includes all left table entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach\n",
    "Simple Approach\n",
    "sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    eu.unique_id,\n",
    "    e.name\n",
    "FROM \n",
    "    Employees e\n",
    "LEFT JOIN \n",
    "    EmployeeUNI eu ON e.id = eu.id;\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Select: We select unique_id from EmployeeUNI and name from Employees. If there's no match for unique_id, NULL will be returned automatically by the LEFT JOIN.\n",
    "Join: Using LEFT JOIN ensures that all employees from the Employees table are included in the result set, even if there's no match in EmployeeUNI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(n)\n",
    ", where n is the number of rows in the Employees table since we need to join each employee with potentially one entry in EmployeeUNI.\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(n), in the worst case, where every employee has a unique ID, or if we consider the result set. However, if we're only considering temporary space used by the SQL engine for joining, it would be less than O(n) due to the nature of how joins are typically optimized."
