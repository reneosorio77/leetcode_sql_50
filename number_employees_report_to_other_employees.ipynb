    "# Intuition\n",
    "The task seems to be about finding managers, counting their direct reports, and calculating the average age of those reports. We need a self join using COUNT and AVG, GROUP BY, ORDER BY. For this problem, we will consider a manager an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "- Use a single `JOIN` since we only need information where the `reports_to` matches the `employee_id`.\n",
    "- Use `LEFT JOIN` to ensure all managers are included, even those without reports. However, since we're only interested in managers with reports, we can use `INNER JOIN` for efficiency but must keep `LEFT JOIN` for the query to work with the given structure.\n",
    "- `WHERE e1.employee_id = e2.reports_to` would ensure we get rid of NULLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** \\(O(n log n)\\) due to sorting (`ORDER BY`). Without sorting, it would be \\(O(n)\\).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** \\(O(n)\\) for storing the join result before aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    e1.employee_id AS employee_id, \n",
    "    e1.name AS name,\n",
    "    COUNT(e2.reports_to) AS reports_count,\n",
    "    ROUND(AVG(e2.age), 0) AS average_age\n",
    "FROM \n",
    "    Employees e1\n",
    "LEFT JOIN \n",
