    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest `id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify Person in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input:\n",
    "**Person table:**\n",
    "| id | email            |\n",
    "|----|------------------|\n",
    "| 1  | john@example.com |\n",
    "| 2  | bob@example.com  |\n",
    "| 3  | john@example.com |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "| id | email            |\n",
    "|----|------------------|\n",
    "| 1  | john@example.com |\n",
    "| 2  | bob@example.com  |\n",
    "\n",
    "# Intuition\n",
    "The task is to remove duplicate email entries from a database table, ensuring we keep only the entry with the smallest `id` for each email. This requires comparing each email with others to decide which records to delete.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "- **SQL (SQLite)**: Since SQLite doesn't allow direct `JOIN` in `DELETE` statements, we use a subquery to find the minimum `id` for each email and delete the rest.\n",
    "- **MySQL**: MySQL supports using `JOIN` directly in `DELETE` statements, making the operation more straightforward by joining the table with itself to compare `id`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solution for SQL (SQLite)\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL like SQLite, we must use `SELECT` within a subquery to identify which rows to delete:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM Person\n",
    "WHERE id NOT IN (\n",
    "    SELECT MIN(id)\n",
    "    FROM Person\n",
    "    GROUP BY email\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "```sql mysql\n",
    "DELETE p1\n",
    "FROM Person p1\n",
    "JOIN Person p2 ON p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "The MySQL solution is generally more efficient since it avoids the overhead of subqueries, directly comparing rows in a self-join. SQLite's method, while less direct, still achieves the goal but might be slower due to the subquery operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity: O(n^2) for both\n",
    "#### Space Complexity: O(1) for both, as operations are in-place."
