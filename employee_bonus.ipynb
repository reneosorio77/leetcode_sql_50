    "# Intuition\n",
    "<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\n",
    "The problem requires us to list employees with bonuses less than 1000 or those without any bonus. We'll need to join the `Employee` and `Bonus` tables to get this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n",
    "- Use a LEFT JOIN to include all employees, even those without a bonus.\n",
    "- Filter the results to show only employees with bonuses less than 1000 or NULL (no bonus).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity:** \n",
    "O(n + m), where `n` is the number of employees and `m` is the number of bonus entries. Here, we consider the join operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity:** \n",
    "O(n), where `n` is the size of the output. The space used is for the result set.\n",
