    "# Intuition\n",
    "The intuition is to compare each number with the two numbers before it to check if they are the same, indicating at least three consecutive occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "We'll use window functions (`LAG`) to access previous rows' values. By comparing the current number with the numbers two and one rows back, we can identify when a number appears at least three times in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity:**\n",
    "  O(n log n) due to the sorting implied by `ORDER BY` in window functions. However, with indexing, this might effectively be closer to $$O(n)$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity:**\n",
    "  O(n), as we're creating a subquery with additional columns for each row of the original table.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums\n",
    "FROM (\n",
    "    SELECT *,\n",
    "        LAG(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS first_lag1,\n",
    "        LAG(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS first_lag2\n",
    "    FROM\n",
    "        Logs\n",
    ") LAGS_1_2\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "    num = first_lag1 AND first_lag1 = first_lag2"

    "# Second less efficient solution\n",
    "### Code (Triple Join Solution)\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums\n",
    "FROM Logs l1\n",
    "JOIN Logs l2 ON l1.id = l2.id - 1\n",
    "JOIN Logs l3 ON l1.id = l3.id - 2\n",
    "WHERE l1.num = l2.num AND l2.num = l3.num;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This approach involves joining the `Logs` table to itself three times to check for consecutive numbers. Each join shifts the row index by one, allowing us to compare each number with the two numbers before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity:**\n",
    "  O(n^3) in the worst case due to the triple join. This can be high for large datasets as it results in many comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity:**\n",
    "  O(n) for the result set, but the operation might require more temporary space due to the joins."
