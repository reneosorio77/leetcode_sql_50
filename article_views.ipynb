    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem involves identifying authors who have viewed their own articles. We need to find rows in the dataset where `author_id` matches `viewer_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approaches\n",
    "```sql \n",
    "### Simple Approach ###\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id\n",
    "FROM Views\n",
    "WHERE author_id = viewer_id\n",
    "ORDER BY id ASC;\n",
    "\n",
    "Select: Use DISTINCT with author_id (aliased as id) to ensure we only get unique authors who viewed their own articles.\n",
    "Filter: Apply a WHERE clause to match author_id with viewer_id.\n",
    "Order: Sort the result by id in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subquery Approach ### \n",
    "sql\n",
    "SELECT id\n",
    "FROM (\n",
    "    SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id\n",
    "    FROM Views\n",
    "    WHERE author_id = viewer_id\n",
    ") AS self_views\n",
    "ORDER BY id ASC;\n",
    "\n",
    "Subquery: Use SELECT DISTINCT to first filter and get unique author_ids where they match viewer_id.\n",
    "Select: Then, select from this subquery result, ordering by ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Query 1: O(n log n)\n",
    "Filtering: O(n) where n is the number of rows in Views.\n",
    "Distinct: This operation might be O(n log n) if sorting is used internally by the database to remove duplicates, or O(n) if hash-based methods are used for uniqueness.\n",
    "Sorting: If we consider the number of unique authors as m, sorting these unique entries takes O(m log m), where m â‰¤ n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query 2: O(n + m log m)\n",
    "Subquery: The subquerys filtering and DISTINCT operations are O(n).\n",
    "Sorting: Sorting the result of the subquery is O(m log m), where m is the count of unique authors who viewed their own articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Query 1: O(n) in the worst case, as we might need to store all rows before ensuring uniqueness through DISTINCT.\n",
    "Query 2: O(m) for storing the unique author_ids after the subquery, where m is the number of unique authors, which could be less than n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "The subquery method might offer a slight performance advantage in scenarios where there are many duplicate views by authors, reducing the dataset before sorting. However, for most practical purposes, the simple approach is equally effective, providing a cleaner, more intuitive solution. Choose based on readability and the specific performance needs of your dataset.\n"
