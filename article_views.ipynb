    "# Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem involves identifying authors who have viewed their own articles. We need to find rows in the dataset where author_id matches viewer_id. My initial thought was to filter the rows and use DISTINCT to ensure unique authors, as multiple views by the same author should not duplicate the result.\n",
    "Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n",
    "1. **Simple Approach**:\n",
    "   - Use `SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id` to get unique authors who viewed their own articles.\n",
    "   - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter rows where `author_id = viewer_id`.\n",
    "   - Sort the result by `id` in ascending order using `ORDER BY id ASC`.\n",
    "2. **Subquery Approach**:\n",
    "   - Use a subquery to first select distinct `author_id` values (aliased as `id`) where `author_id = viewer_id`.\n",
    "   - Select from this subquery and order the results by `id` in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - **Simple Approach**: O(n log n). Filtering is O(n) where n is the number of rows in the Views table. The `DISTINCT` operation might be O(n log n) if sorting is used internally by the database to remove duplicates, or O(n) if hash-based methods are used for uniqueness. Sorting the unique authors (m ≤ n) takes O(m log m).\n",
    "  - **Subquery Approach**: O(n + m log m). The subquery’s filtering and `DISTINCT` operations are O(n). Sorting the result of the subquery is O(m log m), where m is the number of unique authors.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**:\n",
    "  - **Simple Approach**: O(n) in the worst case, as the database might need to store all rows before ensuring uniqueness through `DISTINCT`.\n",
    "  - **Subquery Approach**: O(m) for storing the unique `author_id` values after the subquery, where m is the number of unique authors, which could be less than n.\n",
