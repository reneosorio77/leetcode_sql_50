    "# Intuition\n",
    "<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\n",
    "The key here is to compare each day's temperature with the temperature recorded the previous day. Since SQL doesn't allow direct row-to-row comparisons without additional logic, I thought of using a self-join or subquery to match each day with the day before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n",
    "- Use a self-join on the `Weather` table to pair each day with the previous day.\n",
    "- Compare the temperature of the current day (`w1`) with the previous day (`w2`).\n",
    "- Use `DATE_ADD` to ensure we're comparing consecutive days.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: \n",
    "  - O(n log n) in the worst case where n is the number of records due to the join operation. However, with an index on `recordDate`, this might approach O(n) in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity**: \n",
    "  - O(n) for the temporary result set during the join, though with efficient indexing, this could be mostly disk-based rather than in-memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "```mysql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    w1.id AS id\n",
    "FROM \n",
    "    Weather w1\n",
    "JOIN \n",
    "    Weather w2 ON w1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(w2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)\n",
    "WHERE \n",
    "    w1.temperature > w2.temperature;"
