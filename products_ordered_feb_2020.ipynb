    "# Intuition\n",
    "The problem requires us to find products that have sold at least 100 units within February 2020. My initial thought is to join the `Products` and `Orders` tables, filter for the specific date range, aggregate the units sold, and then filter the results based on the total units.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "1. **Join Tables**: Join `Products` and `Orders` tables on `product_id`.\n",
    "2. **Filter by Date**: Only consider orders from February 2020.\n",
    "3. **Sum Units**: Group by product to sum up the units sold for each product.\n",
    "4. **Filter Results**: Use `HAVING` clause to filter products where the sum of units is 100 or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: \n",
    "  O(n) where \\( n \\) is the number of orders since we scan each order once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity**: \n",
    "  O(n) in the worst case, where \\( n \\) is the number of orders, due to the aggregation of results in memory before filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    p.product_name,\n",
    "    SUM(o.unit) AS unit\n",
    "FROM \n",
    "    Products p\n",
    "JOIN \n",
    "    Orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id\n",
    "WHERE \n",
    "    o.order_date BETWEEN '2020-02-01' AND '2020-02-29'\n",
    "GROUP BY \n",
    "    p.product_id, p.product_name\n",
    "HAVING \n",
    "    SUM(o.unit) >= 100;"
