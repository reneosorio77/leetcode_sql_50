    "# SQL Query to Identify Big Countries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "- **World**\n",
    "  - **name**: VARCHAR - Name of the country\n",
    "  - **continent**: VARCHAR - Continent the country belongs to\n",
    "  - **area**: INT - Area of the country in square kilometers\n",
    "  - **population**: INT - Population of the country\n",
    "  - **gdp**: BIGINT - Gross Domestic Product of the country\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A country is considered \"big\" if:\n",
    "- Its area is at least 3 million square kilometers (3000000 km²), or\n",
    "- Its population is at least 25 million (25000000 people).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an SQL query to find the name, population, and area of these big countries. The result can be in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how the `World` table might look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+\n",
    "| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |\n",
    "+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+\n",
    "| Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |\n",

    "| Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |\n",
    "| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |\n",

    "+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "The problem requires us to filter countries based on either their land area or population size. The key here is to use logical OR conditions in the SQL WHERE clause to match either criteria for defining a 'big' country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach\n",
    "Select: We select name, population, and area columns from the World table.\n",
    "Filter: Use a WHERE clause to filter countries where either:\n",
    "area is greater than or equal to 3,000,000 km², or\n",
    "population is greater than or equal to 25,000,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "Select: The relevant data fields for our output.\n",
    "Where: Apply our conditions with OR logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the World table. Each country must be checked against the criteria.\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(1), since we're selecting three columns without additional space allocation relative to input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Query\n",
    "Here's the SQL query to solve this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT name, population, area\n",
    "FROM World\n",
    "WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000\n",
    "\n",
    "+-------------+------------+---------+\n",
    "| name        | population | area    |\n",
    "+-------------+------------+---------+\n",
    "| Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |\n",
    "| Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |\n",
