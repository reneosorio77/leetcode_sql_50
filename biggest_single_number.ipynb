    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "A single number is a number that appeared only once in the `MyNumbers` table.\n",

    "# Intuition\n",
    "The problem likely requires finding the maximum number that appears only once in the table `MyNumbers`. My first thought is to use a subquery to isolate numbers that appear exactly once, then find the maximum among those.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "1. **Subquery**: Use a subquery to group all numbers by their value and count how many times each number appears. Filter for those numbers that appear exactly once.\n",
    "2. **MAX Function**: Apply the `MAX` function to the result of the subquery to get the highest number among those that appear once.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: \n",
    "  - O(n log n) due to the grouping operation in MySQL which sorts the data.\n",
    "- **Space complexity**: \n",
    "  - O(n) for storing the intermediate result of the subquery.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    MAX(num) AS num\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    (SELECT num FROM MyNumbers GROUP BY num HAVING COUNT(*)=1) AS single_numbers;"
