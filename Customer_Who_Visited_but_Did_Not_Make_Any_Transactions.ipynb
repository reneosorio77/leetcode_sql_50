    "<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\n",
    "The goal is to count how many times each customer visited without making a transaction. We need to identify visits where no corresponding transaction exists. My first thought was to use a `LEFT JOIN` to see which visits don't have transactions, but then I considered that checking for non-existence directly might be more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n",
    "1. **Identify Visits Without Transactions**: Use `NOT EXISTS` to check if there are no transactions for each visit.\n",
    "2. **Count and Group**: Group the results by customer ID and count how many visits without transactions each customer has.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: \n",
    "  - O(V + T), where V is the number of visits and T is the number of transactions. We scan all visits once and for each visit, potentially check all transactions, though in practice, this might be less due to indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity**: \n",
    "  - O(V), assuming we're not considering the memory used by the output. We're essentially dealing with one row at a time from the Visits table, but we do need to keep some state for grouping.\n",
