    "# Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem likely involves analyzing movie ratings from a database. There are two main tasks:\n",
    "1. **Find the user who has rated the most movies.** This involves counting how many movies each user has rated and then selecting the user with the highest count.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Find the movie with the highest average rating in February 2020.** This task requires aggregating ratings for each movie but only for those ratings given in February 2020, then finding the movie with the highest average rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First Query (User with Most Ratings):**\n",
    "  - Use a `LEFT JOIN` to connect `Users` table with `MovieRating` table based on `user_id`. \n",
    "  - `GROUP BY u.user_id` to aggregate ratings per user.\n",
    "  - `COUNT(mr.movie_id)` to count how many movies each user has rated.\n",
    "  - `ORDER BY COUNT(mr.movie_id) DESC, u.name ASC` to sort users first by the number of ratings in descending order, then alphabetically by name. \n",
    "  - `LIMIT 1` to get only the top result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Second Query (Movie with Highest Average Rating in February 2020):**\n",
    "  - `LEFT JOIN` `Movies` with `MovieRating` on `movie_id`.\n",
    "  - Filter ratings with `WHERE MONTH(mr.created_at) = 2 AND YEAR(mr.created_at) = 2020` to match February 2020.\n",
    "  - `GROUP BY m.movie_id` to calculate average rating per movie.\n",
    "  - `ORDER BY AVG(mr.rating) DESC, m.title ASC` to sort by average rating in descending order, then alphabetically by title.\n",
    "  - `LIMIT 1` to fetch the top-rated movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time complexity:** \n",
    "  - Both queries involve a JOIN operation which can be $$O(N \\log N)$$ in the worst case due to sorting, where N is the number of ratings. However, with proper indexing, this might approach linear time $$O(N)$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity:**\n",
    "  - O(N) as we might need to store all ratings temporarily during the join operations before aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql my sql\n",
    "(SELECT u.name AS results\n",
    "FROM Users u\n",
    "LEFT JOIN MovieRating mr ON mr.user_id = u.user_id\n",
    "GROUP BY u.user_id\n",
    "ORDER BY COUNT(mr.movie_id) DESC, u.name ASC\n",
    "LIMIT 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "UNION ALL\n",
    "\n",
    "(SELECT m.title AS results\n",
    "FROM Movies m\n",
    "LEFT JOIN MovieRating mr ON  m.movie_id = mr.movie_id\n",
    "WHERE MONTH(mr.created_at) = 2 AND YEAR(mr.created_at) = 2020\n",
    "GROUP BY m.movie_id\n",
    "ORDER BY AVG(mr.rating) DESC, m.title ASC\n",
    "LIMIT 1)\n",
