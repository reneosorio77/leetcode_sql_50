    "# Intuition\n",
    "We need to count the number of unique users who were active each day for a 30-day period ending on July 27, 2019. An active user is defined as one who performed at least one activity on that day. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select Date Range:** Use `DATE_SUB` to define the start of the 30-day period from July 27, 2019.\n",
    "2. **Count Unique Users:** For each day within this period, count distinct `user_id`s to avoid counting the same user multiple times if they performed multiple activities.\n",
    "3. **Group by Date:** Group the results by `activity_date` to get counts for each day.\n",
    "4. **Order Results:** Sort the results by date to present them in chronological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity:**\n",
    "  - $$O(n \\log n)$$\n",
    "    - Due to grouping and sorting operations. Here, n is the number of activity records within the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity:**\n",
    "  - $$O(n)$$\n",
    "    - We store one entry per unique day in the result set, but since we're dealing with a fixed 30-day period, this is more like \\(O(30)\\), which simplifies to constant space in terms of complexity analysis relative to the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    activity_date AS day,\n",
    "    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    Activity\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "    activity_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY) AND '2019-07-27'\n",
    "GROUP BY\n",
