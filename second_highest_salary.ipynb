    "# Intuition\n",
    "The goal is to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employees table. If there's no second highest salary, we should return `null` to indicate this. Here's the thought process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distinct Salaries**: We need to ensure we only consider unique salary values since multiple employees might have the same salary.\n",
    "- **Sorting**: By sorting salaries in descending order, we can easily pick the second highest salary.\n",
    "- **Selection**: Use `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` to directly access the second highest salary in the sorted list. If there's less than two distinct salaries, we'll return `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Remove Duplicates**: Use `DISTINCT` to consider only unique salary values.\n",
    "2. **Sort Salaries**: Sort salaries in descending order to find the highest to lowest salaries.\n",
    "3. **Select Second Highest**: Use `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1` to select the second highest salary. If there isn't a second salary, this query will return nothing, which we handle by using a subquery to return `null` if no result is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(NlogN) due to the sorting operation where N is the number of employees.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we're not storing additional data structures beyond the query execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    (SELECT DISTINCT salary \n",
    "     FROM Employee\n",
    "     ORDER BY salary DESC\n",
    "     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary;"
