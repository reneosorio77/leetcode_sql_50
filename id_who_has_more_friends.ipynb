    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Intuition\n",
    "<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\n",
    "The problem involves finding the person who has the most friends, where friendship is established by both accepting and requesting friendships. We can use a union to combine both requester and accepter into a single list of IDs to count friendships.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\n",
    "1. Combine all unique IDs from both `requester_id` and `accepter_id` into a single CTE (Common Table Expression).\n",
    "2. Count how many times each ID appears in this combined set, which represents the number of friendships.\n",
    "3. Sort this count in descending order to find the person with the most friendships.\n",
    "4. Limit the result to one row to get the person with the highest count.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity:**\n",
    "  <!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n",
    "  O(n log n), where n is the total number of friendship records because of the sorting operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity:**\n",
    "  <!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\n",
    "  O(n) for storing all IDs in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH cte AS(\n",
    "    SELECT requester_id id FROM RequestAccepted\n",
    "    UNION ALL\n",
    "    SELECT accepter_id id FROM RequestAccepted\n",

    "\n",
    "SELECT id, COUNT(*) num\n",
    "FROM cte\n",
    "GROUP BY id\n",
    "ORDER BY num DESC\n",
